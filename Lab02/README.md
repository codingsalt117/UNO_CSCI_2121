# Lab 2 Javadocs

**Due date: Feb 27, 2022 11:59PM**   

You are given a complete java program (Look at the attached file). The goal of the assignment is to  write javadoc comments (not regular comments). You won't be making any changes to the code itself. You have 4 files to comment:   
* Movable.java     
* MovableCircle.java    
* MovablePoint.java
* MovableRectangle.java

You can ignore the TestApp.java.

**Submission**   
You will need to submit your code with comments along with the generated javadoc files. Failure to do so will be 0 points. (There will be similar exercise in class) 

You will be graded as:
* 40 points - All files and well commented
* 30 points - All files but not poorly commented
* 20 points - Partially commented
* 10 points - Partially commented and poor comments

**Gitlab**
Please submit all your work to gitlab. Make sure you have added me to the repo.
